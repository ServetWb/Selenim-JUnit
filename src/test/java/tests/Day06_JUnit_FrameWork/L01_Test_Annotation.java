    Until now, weâ€™ve said that a class must have a main method
    in order to be runnable.

    And indeed, without a main method,
    the run button does not appear next to the methods.

    The biggest advantage that comes with the JUnit framework
    is the @Test annotation.

    Thanks to the @Test annotation,
    each method can be executed independently.
